# Ally Effect #

## About ##
Ally Effect is a mod that enables players to bestow effects upon each other, themselves and their pets at the push of a button!

By default, the effect gives other players Regen 2, and the player Hunger 2. Heal your friends by sacrificing some saturation!\
This can be changed by making a datapack though, since the Allyship effect under the hood actually just runs two mcfunctions!\
One for the player performing the effect, and one for the player or entity receiving it!

The mod has a nice config, so you can change the animation that plays for players executing the effect, in addition to other things like how often the effect is executed, and what key executes the effect.

Made for the Companionship modpack. Hope you enjoy the mod!
